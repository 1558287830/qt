Qt 4.7.2 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 4.7.0.  For more details,
refer to the online documentation included in this distribution. The
documentation is also available online:

  http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.7

The Qt version 4.7 series is binary compatible with the 4.6.x series.
Applications compiled for 4.6 will continue to run with 4.7.

Some of the changes listed in this file include issue tracking numbers
corresponding to tasks in the Qt Bug Tracker or the Merge Request queue

      The window handle of a native widget may be set to zero in two
      situations: (i) temporarily, during reparenting and (ii) during
      widget destruction.  Previously, no WinIdChange event was sent in
      either of these cases; now, it is sent in both cases.

 - Paging changes
    * [QT-3503] Remove PAGED keyword from all Qt-based binaries for
      MMP-based build systems (abld, SBSv2 (a.k.a. Raptor)).
      This changes the code paging field in the Symbian (E32Image) header
      from "paged" to "default".  Thus it is left to the configuration
      of the particular device whether paging is used for the binary or
      not.  All devices that support code paging should have it turned
      on (the value is stored in the HAL, so can be checked using eg.
      fshell); data paging may or may not be turned on depending on the
      device characteristics.  Leaving both code and data paging as
      "default" means that any limitations in the device (eg. around
      flash wear) can be controlled by that device by disabling the
      appropriate types of paging rather than being forced by the binary
      (which may be deployed to several different devices with different
      characteristics).

 - Phonon MMF backend
   * [QTBUG-11436] Added a MediaObject property which allows the client to
     specify which Internet Access Point should be used for streaming.

   * [QTBUG-15393] Resolve EPOCROOT in qt.conf using same logic as in .pro.
   * [QTBUG-15501] Fix symbian-mmp.conf include path.

   * [QTBUG-16221] Fix libinfixed usage in Symbian when def files are used.
   * [QTBUG-16261] Fix infinite loop in qmake when reading malformed .ts files.
   * [QTBUG-16298] Ignore static_and_shared in Symbian builds.
   * [QTBUG-13769] Generate freeze targets in Symbian.
   * [QTBUG-16691] Remove toolcheck from generic clean targets for symbian-sbsv2.

      in EGL surfaces, setting Qt::WA_TranslucentBackground on a widget
      whose windowType() is Qt::Window causes that widget to be rendered
      using the raster graphics system.
